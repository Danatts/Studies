# Rust Notes

## Data Types

### Scalar Types

#### Integer Type

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
| - | - | - |
| 8-bit | i8 | u8 |
| 16-bit | i16 | u16 |
| 32-bit | i32 | u32 |
| 64-bit | i64 | u64 |
| 128-bit | i128 | u128 |
| arch | isize | usize |

- Defaults types is `i32`.

#### Float Type

```rs
fn main() {
  let x = 2.0; // f64
  let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

- Defaults type is `f64`.

#### Boolean Type

```rs
fn main() {
  let x = true;
  let y: bool = false;
}
```

- Defaults type is `true`.

#### Character Type

```rs
fn main() {
  let c = 'z';
  let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
  let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

- Characters are specified with single quotes.
- `char` type is four bytes in size.

#### String literal

```rs
fn main() {
  let s = "hello, world";
}
```

- String literals are inmutable.
- String literals are specified with double quotes.

#### String Type

```rs
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello, world");
}
```

- String type is mutable.

### Compound Types

#### Tuple Type

- Groups together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type.
- Tuples have fixed length.

```rs
fn main() {
  let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

  // Destructuring a tuple value
  let (x, y, z) = tup; // x = 500, y = 6.4, z = 1

  // Accesing a tuple element
  let five_hundred = tup.0;

  let six_point_four = tup.1;

  let one = x.2;
}
```

#### Array Type

- Every element of an array must have the same type.
- Array have fixed length.
- Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap.

```rs
fn main() {
  let arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  // Same value for each element
  let arr2 = [3u32; 5];

  // Accesing an array element
  let first = arr[0];
  let secong = arr[1];
}
```
## Functions

```rs
fn main () {
  another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
  println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

Function bodies are made up of aseries of statements optionally ending in an expression.

- **Statements** are instructions that perform some action and no not return a value.
- **Expressions** evaluate to a resultant value. They do not include ending semicolon.

### Functions with Return Values

```rs
fn five() -> i32 {
  5
}

fn main() {
  let x = five();

  println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

You can return early from a function by using the `return` keyword and specifying a value.

## Control Flow

### `if` Expressions

```rs
fn main() {
  let number = 6;

  if number % 4 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 4");
  } else if number % 3 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 3");
  } else if number % 2 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 2");
  } else {
    println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
  }
}
```

Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and
always provide `if` with a Boolean as its condition.

### Using `if` in a `let` statement

```rs
fn main() {
  let condition = true;
  let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

  println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

The value that have the potential to be results from each arm of the `if` must be the same type.

### Repeating code with `loop`

```rs
loop {
  let mut guess = String::new();

  io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
    .expect("Failed to read line");

  let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
    Ok(num) => num,
      Err(_) => continue,
  };

  println!("You guessed: {guess}");

  match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
    Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
      Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
      Ordering::Equal => {
        println!("You win!");
        break;
      }
  }
}
```
### Returning values from loops

To do this, you can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression you use to stop the
loop. That value will be returned out of the loop so you can use it.

```rs
fn main() {
  let mut counter = 0;

  let result = loop {
    counter += 1;

    if counter == 10 {
      break counter * 2;
    }
  };

  println!("The result is {result}");
}
```

### Loop Labels to disambiguate between multiple loops

If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost loop at that point.
You can optionally specify a *loop label* on a loop that you can then use with `break` or `continue`
to specify that those keywords apply to the labeledloop instead of the innermost loop.

- Loop labels must begin with a single quote.

```rs
fn main() {
  let mut count = 0;
  'counting_up: loop {
    println!("count = {count}");
    let mut remaining = 10;

    loop {
      println!("remaining = {remaining}");
      if remaining == 9 {
        break;
      }
      if count == 2 {
        break 'counting_up;
      }
      remaining -= 1;
    }

    count += 1;
  }
  println!("End count = {count}");
}
```
### Conditional loops with `while`

```rs
fn main() {
  let mut number = 3;

  while number != 0 {
    println!("{number}!");

    number -= 1;
  }

  println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

### Looping through a collection with `for`

```rs
fn main() {
  let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

  for element in a {
    println!("the value is: {element}");
  }
}
```

### Looping through a range with `for`

```rs
fn main() {
  for number in (1..4).rev() {
    println!("{number}!");
  }
  println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

## Ownership

### Ownership and functions

Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assigment does.

```rs
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

  takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                  // ... and so is no longer valid here

  let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

  makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                  // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                  // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
  println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
  println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

### Return values and scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership.

```rs
fn main() {
  let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                      // value into s1

  let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

  let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                      // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                      // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

  let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

  some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                           // moves out to the calling
                                           // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

  a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}

```
